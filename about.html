    <h2>About Us</h2>
  </aside>
  <main>
    <p>We are a group of families and individuals in Toronto sponsoring a Syrian refugee family. We're from the Annex and Kensington neighbourhoods of Toronto and we want to welcome a refugee family into our community.</p>
    <p>Together, we have been moved by the images and stories of Syrian refugees fleeing war and persecution. We will do everything we can to settle a new refugee family comfortably to Toronto and make them feel welcome. The funds we raise will be used to pay for housing, transportation costs, new clothes and winter coats, and other needs that will arise. As part of the private sponsorship process the government of Canada has set up, any private sponsorship group must raise $20,000 as part of the process.</p>
